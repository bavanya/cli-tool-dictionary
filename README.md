# cli-tool-dictionary
command line tool to get the definition of the word entered.

The tool was developed using Node.JS.
Axios client was used to call the API.

Used: https://github.com/meetDeveloper/googleDictionaryAPI

**Future Work**

The API also includes the url of the audio for each word.
So, audio sound must be heared when a word is entered with the CLI.
